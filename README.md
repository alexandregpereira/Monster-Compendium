- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html): A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html): Stream of data that can be computed asynchronously. Built in top of the Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin): A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin & Kotlin Multiplatform.
- [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight): A multiplatform SQLite library that generates Kotlin typesafe APIs from SQL statements.
- [Ktor-client](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor): A multiplatform asynchronous HTTP client for Kotlin, providing a clean and extensible API for making network requests.
- [Multiplatform Settings](https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings): A library that provides a simple and consistent API for persisting key-value data across iOS, Android, and JVM platforms.
- [Coil Compose](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose): An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines and Jetpack Compose.
- [Kotlin Serialization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html): A library for parsing and serializing JSON data, seamlessly converting API responses into Kotlin objects.

## App Architecture

The app's architecture is based on the Model-View-Intent (MVI) pattern with Clean Architecture principles, implemented in a multi-module project, as illustrated in the image below:

### Components Responsibilities

- **UI**: It is responsible for displaying data from the UI State to the user and handling user interactions.
- **StateHolder**: It holds and send the UI State, manages the app's UI state and logic, and dispatches changes when receiving intents, enabling a reactive UI experience.
- **UseCases**: It contains the business logic, retrieving data from the Repository interface or coordinating with other use cases to perform complex tasks.
- **Repository**:  It acts as a mediator between different data sources (network or database) and converts the data models into domain models, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **DataSources**: It is responsible for fetching and transferring data from a single source, such as an API or a local database, and returning the data in a consistent format.

## API

Currently, there is no dedicated backend for the app. The app retrieves the data from static JSON files stored [here](https://github.com/alexandregpereira/hunter-api). The JSON were formatted from the API https://dnd5eapi.co.
