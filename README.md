### Components Responsibilities

- **UI**: It is responsible to show the data from the UI State to the user.
- **ViewModel**: It is the UI state holder. It transforms the domain model to UI State and holds it, sending to the UI.
- **UseCases**: It holds the business logic. Getting data from the Repository interface or over other use cases.
- **Repository**: It converts the data models (network and database) to domain models.
- **DataSources**: It transfers data from a single source only.

## API

There is no backend for now. The app retrieves the data from JSON files stored [here](https://github.com/alexandregpereira/hunter-api). The JSON were formatted from the API https://dnd5eapi.co.
